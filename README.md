## 📋 Overview

The Inbound Banking Support Agent addresses critical challenges faced by banking customer service teams: **high call volumes**, **repetitive queries**, **strict compliance requirements**, and **complex verification needs**. Built entirely on the Inya.ai no-code platform, this solution demonstrates how conversational AI can transform traditional IVR systems into intelligent, natural experiences without writing a single line of code.

### 🎯 Problem Solved

Banks receive thousands of daily customer inquiries for routine tasks like balance checks, card blocking, and branch location. Traditional IVR systems are menu-driven, frustrating, and require 4-6 minutes per call. This agent reduces handling time to under 2 minutes while maintaining compliance and providing superior customer experience.

This action cannot be undone. Should I proceed?
```

**Success Response Template:**
```

**User:** "Debit card"
**Bot:** "Please provide the last 4 digits of your debit card."

**User:** "9012"
**Bot:** "I will block your debit card ending in 9012. This action cannot be undone. Should I proceed?"

**Bot:** "Your debit card ending in 9012 has been blocked successfully. Reference: BLK987654321. A replacement will arrive in 7 business days."

### Error Handling Flows

**ASR Failure Handling:**
```
[Low Confidence Detected]
↓
[Retry Counter < 2?]
↓ Yes
[Response: "I didn't catch that. Could you repeat?"]
↓ Listen Again
[Still Low Confidence & Retry = 2]
↓
[Response: "Having trouble hearing. Let me connect you to specialist"]
↓
[Trigger Escalation]
```

**Entity Validation Error:**
```
[Collect: account_number]
↓
[Validate: 12-14 digits]
↓ Failed
[Error Count < 2]
↓
[Response: "Account numbers are 12-14 digits. Please provide again."]
↓ Retry
[Still Invalid & Count = 2]
↓
[Offer Escalation]
```
